        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>
        St Patrick’s High School is located in Saddar Town, Karachi, Pakistan. It was established on 6th May 1861, began with just three students, and officially registered as a high school in 1867. Its founder was Reverend Joseph A. Willy of the Society of Jesus, which managed the school for almost 75 years. It was then taken over by the Franciscan order until 6 October 1950, and since then it has had Pakistani principals belong to the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Karachi. The School is now owned by the Roman Catholic Church (Archdiocese of Karachi) and managed by the Catholic Board of Education Karachi in Pakistan. <br><br>

        Our first Pakistani principal was Fr. Stephen Raymond, whose era from 1950 to 1974 is referred to by many old students as the  Golden Era of St Patrick's. Fr Raymond was known for constructing the Cambridge Building (1950), St Patrick's College (1952), the Teachers' Training College (1959), and the first School Auditorium (1972). <br><br>

        Education at St. Patrick’s begins at ECCE (Early Childhood Care and Education) – Kindergarten – and carries on till Matriculate (HSC), or CAIE Advanced Level (Cambridge). For over 150 years, we have served the people of the sub-continent and Pakistan by providing accessible education.
